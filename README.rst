=================================
Product Embeddings with Prod2BERT
=================================

Code is complete, but the readme is still a working progress.
It should not be difficult to use this as all the code is contained in a single class
And it makes use of a general .fit method.

Most of the code has been taken from here: https://keras.io/examples/nlp/masked_language_modeling/
We added minor stuff to better adapt it to our use case.
